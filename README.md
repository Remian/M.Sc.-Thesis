Title:
Investigation on Parametric Eigen Analysis
Based Models for Computationally Efficient and Robust
Spectral Feature Information Extraction from Neural EEG
waveform in Emotional State Classification

Summarized Description:
In this research we explored varieties of parametric PSD (Power Spectral
Density) estimator models which use Eigen matrix decomposition, in EEG
feature extraction tasks. The research also makes detailed analysis on
estimations for subspace dimensionality of EEG waveforms, an indispensable
parameter for Eigen analysis based parametric PSD estimators. We observed
the t and p-values of standard deviation, absolute deviation, statistical
norms and other statistical parameters for the computed spectrums to analyze
spectral correlations. The research implements PCA for reducing the feature
dimension space and also explores the use of Autoencoders. We have also
explored the concept of generating EEG Topographic images from the
computed spectrums, as possible feature extraction method. The extracted
features were used on convolution neural networks, LSTM networks and
multilayer perceptron networks for classification tasks. For detailed data
visualization, we have used statistical Seaborn libray and Matplotlib3D. Plots and more
details of the research are available here (https://sites.google.com/bibeat.com/11648abrar).
